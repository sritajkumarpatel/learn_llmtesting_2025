Text Summarization Utility (Hugging Face Transformers)
======================================================

What is Text Summarization?
- Condenses long text into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving key information
- Uses sequence-to-sequence transformer models trained for abstractive summarization
- Generates human-like summaries that capture main ideas and essential details

How It Works:
- Takes: text input string and optional max_length parameter (default 150)
- Loads BART-large-CNN model fine-tuned for summarization tasks
- Processes text through encoder-decoder architecture to generate summary
- Returns: concise summary text within specified length constraints

Use Cases:
- Content summarization for articles and documents
- Meeting notes and transcript condensation
- Research paper abstract generation
- News article summarization
- Educational content simplification
- Social media post summarization
