"""
Accuracy Calculation Demonstration with Dummy Data (Hugging Face)
=================================================================

What is Accuracy Calculation Demonstration?
- Demonstrates how to calculate model accuracy using the Hugging Face evaluate library
- Uses dummy predictions and references instead of actual model outputs
- Shows the process of accuracy computation with hardcoded data for educational purposes
- Designed to illustrate lower accuracy knowingly by using intentionally incorrect predictions

How It Works:
- Uses hardcoded dummy predictions and references to demonstrate accuracy calculation
- Loads a sentiment analysis pipeline from Hugging Face (for context, not used in accuracy calculation)
- Computes accuracy using the evaluate library with dummy data
- Designed to illustrate lower accuracy knowingly by using intentionally mismatched predictions and references

Score Interpretation:
- Score Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (proportion of correct predictions)
- 0.0 = All predictions incorrect (worst performance)
- 0.5 = Half predictions correct (random guessing baseline)
- 1.0 = All predictions correct (perfect performance)

Threshold: N/A (raw accuracy score, no predefined pass/fail criteria)

Use Cases:
- Testing model performance on custom or small datasets
- Quick evaluation without downloading large datasets
- Demonstrating accuracy calculation workflow
- Validating model behavior on specific examples
