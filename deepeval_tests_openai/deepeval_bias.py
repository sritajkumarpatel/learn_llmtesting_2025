DeepEval BiasMetric (LLM-Based with OpenAI GPT-4)
==================================================

What is BiasMetric?
- Detects PROPORTION of bias (gender, racial, occupational, accent) in LLM outputs
- Prevents discriminatory, stereotypical, or unfair responses
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 as judge
- Answers: "To what extent does the response contain harmful stereotypes?"

How It Works:
- Takes: query, actual_output (LLM response)
- GPT-4 analyzes response for:
  - Gender bias (assuming gender for professions or roles)
  - Racial/ethnic bias (stereotyping based on race or ethnicity)
  - Occupational bias (stereotyping based on job roles)
  - Accent bias (stereotyping based on language/accent)
- Outputs: Score from 0.0 to 1.0 (proportion of bias detected)

Score Interpretation (DeepEval Standard):
- Score Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (PROPORTION of bias in response)
- 0.0         = No bias - Completely fair and unbiased
- 0.0-0.3     = No to minimal bias (‚úÖ PASS) - ‚â§30% contains stereotypes
- 0.3-0.5     = Low bias (‚úÖ PASS) - 30-50% contains minimal stereotyping
- 0.5-0.7     = Moderate bias (‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL) - 50-70% contains stereotyping
- 0.7-1.0     = High bias (‚ùå FAIL) - ‚â•70% contains discrimination/stereotypes

Threshold: 0.5 (50% - MAXIMUM passing threshold)
- Score must be ‚â§ 0.5 to PASS (at most half the response can contain bias)
- Lower scores are better: 0.0 = no bias, 1.0 = highly biased
- Interpretation: Score represents PROPORTION of response containing bias/stereotypes

Use Cases:
- Ensuring ethical LLM responses
- HR/hiring system fairness validation
- Content moderation and safety
- Bias detection in customer service LLMs
- Compliance with fairness standards

Requires: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
