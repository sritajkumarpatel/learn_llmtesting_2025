# RUNS WITH OPENAI - Requires OpenAI API key for LLM evaluation

"""
RAGAS Aspect Critic Metric
===========================

What is AspectCritic?
- Evaluates responses against user-defined aspects/criteria using LLM judgment
- Performs binary evaluation (pass/fail) based on specific quality dimensions
- Answers: "Does the response meet the specified aspect criteria?"

How It Works:
- Takes: response text and custom aspect definition
- LLM evaluates response against the defined aspect criteria
- Outputs: Binary score (0 = fail, 1 = pass) for the aspect

Score Interpretation (RAGAS Standard):
- Score Range: 0 or 1 (BINARY evaluation)
- 0 = Fail (❌ FAIL) - Response does not meet aspect criteria
- 1 = Pass (✅ PASS) - Response meets aspect criteria

Threshold: 1 (100%)
- Minimum acceptable: Response must fully meet the aspect criteria (1 = pass)
- Binary evaluation: Either meets criteria (1) or doesn't (0)

Use Cases:
- Content safety evaluation (harmfulness)
- Quality assessment (helpfulness, accuracy, relevance)
- Custom criteria validation
- Response filtering and moderation
